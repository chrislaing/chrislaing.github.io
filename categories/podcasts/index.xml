      <description>I just discovered kops, apparently an excellent way to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on the cloud. Since managing a k8s cluster seems to be a full-time job at the best of times, I&#39;m interested to see if this really does make it much easier. I have a very mild case of podcast addiction, and am always looking for something great to add to my collection of subscriptions. Nikita Voloboev has published a very interesting list of podcasts.</description>
